# Place shared icons, images, fonts and other static assets here.
# Example URL paths once collected:
#   /static/assets/icons/...
#   /static/assets/images/...
#   /static/assets/fonts/...
#   /static/assets/logos/...
#
# Django is already configured with STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']
# so anything under /static is served at /static/.
